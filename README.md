# Notes:

## Tutorial:

Step 1: Be sure your system language is set to Japanese (Game language can be too)<br>Step 2: Choose the psv file you want and transfer it to ux0:vitacheat/db on vitashell via FTP or USB<br>Step 3: Open your Minecraft and enjoy :D

## Caution:

GabrielChan's can crash your game if not changed<br>The "All Cheats" Cheat is meant to find the cheat you want and move it to your cheat file, doesn't work when moved to db because of cheat overflow
